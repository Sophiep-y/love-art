    Here is the latest from the young but ascending Tom Polo following his inclusion (which was a highlight) in this year's Adelaide Biennial....and I still think he's one of the more interesting painters of his generation in Australia...and one of the few who are actively working towards being more Global. This year he showed in Paris during Paris+ par Art Basel, in Singapore, Brussels and just last week at West Bund in Shanghai.

I've put them in order of my preference. Let me know asap if any are of interest, there's always high demand for his work xxxA
